# Hosung Joo, AI-based Sensing System Engineer
Hi. My name is Hosung Joo. About my name, 'Ho' means <b>light</b> or <b>bright</b>, and 'sung' means <b>sound</b>. There, I've always wanted to spread such diverse light and sound in the world. It is not surprising that I was into music and spatial engineering. Taking <i>light (i.e. electro-magnetic waves)</i> into my life, I have naturally become an electrical engineer who looks after the wireless communication and signal processing.

I graduated from <i>Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)</i> in 2018 (majored in EE with minor degree of CS; graduated with a report and an implementation of 3D image stitching), and I have a Master's degree from <i>Korea University of Science and Technology (UST)</i> for RF circuits and antenna design. (Thesis: Design of low-loss beam-steering array antenna) Consequently, I worked in <i>Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute (ETRI)</i> as an antenna engineer from Mar. 2019 to Feb. 2021.

I am currently pursuing on my PhD (3rd year) in <i>Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) in the Department of Electrical Engineering</i>. My research interests are based on integrated sensor applications including radar, X-ray imaging, 3D meta-structure design (think of RIS or the lens effect), 3D image and point-cloud classification and reconstruction, artificial intelligence (AI), and modern wireless communication with localization by information fusion.

I am working on AI as an automatic processor on arbitrary signals. I think that positioning and localization problems should be studied for several side-channels including RF, sonic wave, computer vision and X-rays. I dream of <i>cheap and convenient multimodal sensors for human beings to control computers easier</i> (i.e. human-computer interface; HCI with better sensors). Therefore, my research question is "Where does the signal come from? and How much can we be sure of that?"

Also, I am always interested with brain-computer interfaces since I was a science high school student (I was on the first place on Biology, Physics, and Computer Science at that time). If you happen to come up with some ideas in your mind, please do not hesitate to contact me. I love debating on those stuff.

You may look up my previous publications on <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=4faCzH8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">here</a>. Many of domestic (in-Korea) works were excluded.

## Teaching Experience

I am an expert in teaching. I am good at producing materials to study over. I had been rigorously trained to maintain the readable quality of the materials since I started teaching others as a paid teaching assistant (TA) in 2003. (I was born in 1993. Pretty fast to be a TA, isn't it?) I can effectively explain with my every teaching materials, indeed.

My teaching ability comes from my learning experience. I was always summarizing the ideas that I've heard of, thus, I was able to reproduce what I've learned.

- 2023      POSTECH TA & Session Lecturer on Signals & Systems(EECE233-01), Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning(EECE695-O)
- 2022      POSTECH Head TA & Session Lecturer on Introduction to Artificial Intelligence(EECE695-V)
- 2022      POSTECH TA on IRP(High school students' Research Program)
- 2022      Took a Teaching Methodology (extracurriculum) course in POSTECH. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15X1rQAO1y33lk6iv1xclfuXvls2dtGqj/view?usp=drivesdk">(certificate)</a>
