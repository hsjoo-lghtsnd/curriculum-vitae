# "Hello World!" that's what he said.
Hi. My name is Hosung Joo. On my name, 'Ho' means <b>light</b> or <b>bright</b>, and 'sung' means <b>sound</b>. There, I've always wanted to spread such light and sound in the world. It is not surprising that I was into music and spatial engineering. Taking <i>light (i.e. electro-magnetic waves)</i> into my life, I have naturally become an electrical engineer who looks after the wireless communication and signal processing.

I have Master's degree of EE. (Thesis: Design of low-loss array antenna)

I am currently pursuing on PhD in POSTECH. I am working on artificial intelligence (AI) as a automatic processor on arbitrary signals.
