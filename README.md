# "Hello World!"
Hi. My name is Hosung Joo. About my name, 'Ho' means <b>light</b> or <b>bright</b>, and 'sung' means <b>sound</b>. There, I've always wanted to spread such light and sound in the world. It is not surprising that I was into music and spatial engineering. Taking <i>light (i.e. electro-magnetic waves)</i> into my life, I have naturally become an electrical engineer who looks after the wireless communication and signal processing.

I graduated from KAIST in 2018 (majored in EE with minor degree of CS; graduated with a report and an implementation of 3D image stitching), and I have a Master's degree for RF circuit and antenna design. (Thesis: Design of low-loss beam-steering array antenna)

I am currently pursuing on PhD (2nd year) in POSTECH.

I am working on artificial intelligence (AI) as an automatic processor on arbitrary signals. I think that positioning and localization problems should be studied for several side-channels including RF, sonic wave, computer vision and X-rays. I dream of <i>cheap and convenient multimodal sensors for human beings to control computers easier</i> (i.e. human-computer interface; HCI with better sensors). Therefore, my research question is "Where does the signal come from? and How much can we be sure of that?"

Also, I am always interested with brain-computer interfaces since I was a science high school student (I was on the first place on Biology, Physics, and Computer Science at that time). If you happen to come up with some ideas in your mind, please do not hesitate to contact me. I love debating on those stuff.

You may look up my previous publications on <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=4faCzH8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">here</a>. Many of domestic (in-Korea) works were excluded.

## Contacts

I like to use the ID: zxcqa123

It is very convenient to type in with a QWERTY keyboard. By the way, the number '123' is from my birthday Dec., 3th.

You may contact me via e-mail when you type zxcqa123@gmail.com / zxcqa123@postech.ac.kr / zxcqa123@kaist.ac.kr ... so on.

## Teaching Experience

I am an expert in teaching. I am good at producing materials to study over. I had been rigorously trained to maintain the readable quality of the materials since I started teaching others as a paid teaching assistant (TA) in 2003. (I was born in 1993. Pretty fast to be a TA, isn't it?) I can effectively explain with my every teaching materials, indeed.

My teaching ability comes from my learning experience. I was always summarizing the ideas that I've heard of, thus, I was able to reproduce what I've learned.

- 2023      POSTECH TA on Signals & Systems(EECE233-01), Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning(EECE695-O)
- 2022      POSTECH Head TA on Introduction to Artificial Intelligence(EECE695-V)
- 2022      POSTECH TA on IRP(High school students' Research Program)
- 2022      Took a Teaching Methodology (extracurriculum) course in POSTECH.
- 2021      POSTECH TA on Introduction to Artificial Intelligence(EECE695-V)
- 2018      Paid 'Hakwon' (<i>"Wisemann Genius Teaching"</i> in Cheonan, South Korea) Teacher for the students entering the Science High School
- 2011-2015 Paid Home-school Teacher + Paid School (extracurriculum) Teacher in <i>GYEONGGI ACADEMY OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES</i>
- 2005      Paid Home-school Teacher (My student got awarded from a science fair!)
- 2003-2005 Paid TA for home-schooling

## Leadership Experience

- AiSLab (POSTECH) student leader, 2022.7 to now
    - Lab Safety Manager, 2022.7 to now
    - Lab student admin, 2022.7 to now
    - (planned) AI & Communication Study Leader, from 2023.9
- Served as the representative of social service agents for National Tax Office in Cheonan, South Korea. 2015-2017
- Founded a student crew in KAIST (name: FUZE), 2014.
    - "We fuze music, we fuze people"
    - I told you I was into music. The crew holds 50+ members for now. I've made up the rules and systems for it.
